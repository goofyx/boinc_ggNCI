Steps to complete installation:

-  Change Apache configuration (as root):

   If you are using Apache 2.4, edit the /home/boincadm/goofyx_grid_nci/goofyx_grid_nci.httpd.conf
   (see file for specific instructions).

   cat /home/boincadm/goofyx_grid_nci/goofyx_grid_nci.httpd.conf >> /etc/apache/httpd.conf

   (path to httpd.conf varies; try /etc/httpd/ or /etc/apache2)

   Then restart the web server:

   /usr/sbin/apache2ctl restart
   (or /usr/sbin/apachectl restart)

-  Add to crontab (as boincadm)

    crontab -e

    and add the line:

    0,5,10,15,20,25,30,35,40,45,50,55 * * * * cd /home/boincadm/goofyx_grid_nci ; /home/boincadm/goofyx_grid_nci/bin/start --cron


-  In the project home directory (/home/boincadm/goofyx_grid_nci) run

    bin/xadd
